# Perudo Calculator

After playing a few rounds of [Perudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudo) during the end of the year 2020, I've decided to try to code up a decision-helper for the game.
My aim here is to use something like [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) to have a working UI.

## TODO List

* Create a first static page
* Perform a calculation for 1 player with 1 normal dice.
* Add the Perudo rule for the value 1.
* Add the ability to have several dices (still only one player).
* Add the ability to have several players.
